This directory contains a framework for running RTEMS applications
on simulators.  These help run the simulators in a consistent manner
and detect programs which have faulted.

NOTES:

[1] The script name is intended to match the name of the BSP it will run
    executables for.  But there are a few scripts which can run multiple BSPs:
	simsh - 
	h8sim - h8sim, h8sxsim

[2] The BSPs ant5206, csb350, and csb360 do not run yet on Skyeye.  This
    is a known Skyeye issue being addressed.

[3] The bf537Stamp and ezkit533 patches to Skyeye.  This is expected to
    be resolved eventually.
